### vau

- Allow multi-line editing in the repl

- Add read/load functions in vau

- Investigate tail call optimization (and ability to instrospect on this so as to highlight tail calls when they are possible)

- Data structure callables (such as dicts being functions of their keys). But note that this should be done with a combination of traits/concepts and data schemas

### vau-lang.org

- github pages

- generate site statically in vau

- blog with standard post, etc.

- vau: a lisp story
    
    - blog series
    
    - each commit to vau automatically becomes a blog post

    - in the farther future, have a way to associate parts of the commit comment with file change regions so those can be displayed inline in the article
