- Allow multi-line editing in the repl

- Add read/load functions in vau

- Investigate tail call optimization (and ability to instrospect on this so as to highlight tail calls when they are possible)

- Data structure callables (such as dicts being functions of their keys). But note that this should be done with a combination of traits/concepts and data schemas
